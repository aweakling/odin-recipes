Finished with my 1st TOP project
In my own experience the way TOP teaches is very good, i am always looking forward to new lessons
i am having a great time and i know i will have a hard time following this path but TOP makes it worth it
i want to look back at this project again once i achieve my goals and see how far i made it.
